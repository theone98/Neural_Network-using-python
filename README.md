# Neural_Network-using-python

Creating a simple neural network in Python with one input layer (3 inputs) and one output neuron. A neural network with no hidden layers is called a perceptron. In the training_version.py I train the neural network in the clearest way possible, but it's not really useable. The outputs of the training can be found in outputs.txt . neural_network.py is an object and can be used by giving in different inputs.

# What does it do?
The neural_net.py tries to predict the output given 3 binary inputs. If the first input is 1, the output should be one. Otherwise the output should be 0.
